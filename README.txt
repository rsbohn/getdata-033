Objective: Provide a tidy dataset based on "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones", along with a Codebook.md and this readme.txt file.

The raw dataset comes from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0 [1]

[1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

The raw dataset should be downloaded and extracted to the working directory.

The raw dataset includes training data and test data. The tidy dataset will combine both of these into one table.
